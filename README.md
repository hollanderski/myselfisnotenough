# My self is not enough

Selected for the Jeune Création prize organized by Jennifer Flay (FIAC), Ninon Lizé Masclef in collaboration with Félix Ramon, conceived the installation « My self is not enough ». The digital device challenges visitors to play the game of love with their own reflection. The work is visible during exhibition « Roaming... » at Espace Niemeyer – Siège du parti communiste in Paris from September 5th to 22nd. 


The device includes a one-way mirror, screen, camera and a face tacking software. When the viewer approaches the mirror, a voice comes to meet them and offers to play a game. When the viewer tries to go away or stop focus his gaze, the machine begs them to stay by his side.
 
Little by little, the viewer is pulled into an ambiguous monologue with the machine. 
Using the process of interpellation and apparatus, the installation is designed to lure the viewer into social interactions with the device, enticing them to study their own self-image and identity.
