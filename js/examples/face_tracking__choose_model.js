/**
 * BRFv5 - Choosing the right model for your project:
 *
 * '42l_min', '42l_medium', '42l_max'
 * '68l_min', '68l_medium', '68l_max'
 * 'fd_only'
 *
 * TL;DR:
 * 42l for 3d try-on apps, 68l for full tracking,
 * _max on desktop, _min on mobile.
 * 'fd_only' if no Face Tracking.
 *
 * There are two models available, the standard 68 landmarks version and
 * a model with 42 landmarks.
 *
 * The 68l model gives you full mouth and eye tracking, while the 42l model
 * mostly omits mouth and eyes, only tracking eye and mouth corners.
 *
 * The 42l model was designed to have a smaller file size and faster
 * processing time, giving a 3d engine, like ThreeJS, a bit more time
 * per frame for its additional processing.
 *
 * Max, medium and min versions of each model are a trade-off between file size,
 * speed and accuracy.
 *
 * While min files are smaller, they contain fewer cascades and are therefor less
 * accurate in edge cases. Max files are larger, the tracking takes longer, but
 * the tracking is more accurate in edge cases.
 * Rule of thumb: Max may be used on desktop and min on mobile platforms.
 *
 * fd_only can be loaded, if absolutely no Face Tracking is done.
